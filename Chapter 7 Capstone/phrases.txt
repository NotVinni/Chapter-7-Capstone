Dave watched as the forest
burned up on the hill
only a few miles
from her house
The car had been
hastily packed
Marta was inside
trying to round
up the last
of the pets
Dave went through
his mental
list of the most
important papers
He scolded himself
not having prepared
these better
hoped that he
had remembered
everything
that was needed
He continued
to wait for Marta
she still was
nowhere to be seen
He really
has no idea
come up with excuses
that would
keep her calm
when she found out
what happened
the more
I could see
none of them
would work
He was going
to get her wrath
here was nothing
I could say
He ordered his
regular breakfast
Two eggs sunnyside up
hash browns
two strips of bacon
He continued to look
at the menu
wondering if this
would be the day
he added something new
This was also part
of the routine
few seconds of hesitation
before demuring and saying
same exact meal
past two years
mouth on your face
never noticed before
have you noticed
outline the eyes
He was an expert
watched in amazement
fully understand
years to perfect
without even putting
a perfect cone
terrifying feeling
want to look
unable to act
what to do next
